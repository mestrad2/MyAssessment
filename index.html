    <p>Scruffy was very energetic at a young age. We adopted him when I was in middle school from a local animal shelter here in Charlotte, NC.
      Unfortunately in April 2021 we had to put him down due to old age and his arthritis. He was a happy, laid back dog and he was an enormous part of my life growing up.

    <h3>Questions about Scruffy</h3>
    <!--I decided on using a description list for this Q&A section to include both the question and the answer below-->
    <dl>
      <dt>How old was Scruffy when you first adopted him?</dt>
      <dd>He was around 3 or 4 years old, the shelter was not 100% sure of his age but that is what they believed his age was at the time.</dd>
      <dt>German Shephards can be quite big, was Scruffy a big dog also?</dt>
      <dd>He was actually quite a bit smaller than other German Shephards because of him being mixed with Wired-Haired Griffin. Those dogs are very small.</dd>
